Here are some example programs for ZephyrRTOS:

- [accel_display](https://github.com/610t/zephyr-playground/tree/main/samples/boards/bbc/microbit/accel_display): Move dot using an accelerometer.
- [dot_eater](https://github.com/610t/zephyr-playground/tree/main/samples/boards/bbc/microbit/dot_eater): The dot eat game.

The following demonstrations require an [M5Stack Joystick](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/joystick_1.1) and Grove shield.

- [m5stack_joystick](https://github.com/610t/zephyr-playground/tree/main/samples/boards/bbc/microbit/m5stack_joystick): Show joystick information at serial output.
- [m5stack_joystick_display](https://github.com/610t/zephyr-playground/tree/main/samples/boards/bbc/microbit/m5stack_joystick_display): Move dot with Joystick.
